# Introduction to information security and cybersecurity
## Information security vs cybersecurity
 | **Aspect**                | **Information security (InfoSec)**                                                                                         | **Cybersecurity**                                                                                                                           |

 | **Definition**            | Protection of **all forms of information** (digital or physical) from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction.   | Protection of **digital assests, systems, networks, and data** from cyberattacks originating through the internet or other digital means.   |
 | **Scope**                 | Broader - includes **data in any form** (printed, spoken, written, or electronic).                                         | Narrower - focuses specifically on **digital and network-based threats.                                                                     |
 | **Objective**             | Ensure **Confidentially, Intergerity, and Availabity (CIA)** of information, regardless of medium.                         | Protect **computers, networks, servers, and data** from online attacks, breaches, and malware.                                              |
 | **Primary Focus**         | Data production (physical & digital).                                                                                      | system and network defense (digital only).                                                                                                  |

 ## Simplified Understanding
 Information security = Protecting all kind of information
 *   Digital + Physical

Cybersecurity = Protecting digital assests
* Internet + Network Systems

In shorts:

Cybersecurity is a subset of Information Security.


## Example Comparison
| Situation                                           | InfoSec View                                                      | Cybersecurity View
|---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------
| A hacker steals customer database from a website    | Concerned about **loss of confidentiality** of customer data.     | Concerned about **how the hacker breached the server** and **network vulnerabilities**.
| Employee prints confidential data and leaks it      | **Handled under InfoSec** (Physical data breach).                 |  Not considered a **cyber** issue (no digital attack involved).
## Summary
| Point        | InfoSec             | Cybersecurity          |
| ----------   | --------------------| -----------------------|
| Focus        | Data (any form)     | Digital environment    |
| Coverage     | Broader             | Subset of InfoSec      |
| Threat Type  | Physical + Digital  | Only Digital           |
| Goal         | CIA of all data     | CIA of digital assests |
