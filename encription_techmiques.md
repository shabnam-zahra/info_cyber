# Encription Techniques
## Learning Objectives 
- Understand crystography basics
- Differentiate between symmetric and asymmetric encryption
- Learn hashing and digital signature concepts
## Cryptography 
Cryptography is a technique of securing information and communications using codes to ensure confidentially , Integrity and authentication.
## Symmetric Encryption
- Uses one key for both encryption and decryption.
- Fast, suitable for bulk data encryption.
## Asymmetric Encription 
- Uses two keys: Public key (for encryption) & Private key (for decryption).
- Used for secure key exchange and digital communication.
## Hashing
- Converts data into a fixed-length string.
- One-way proccess - cannot be reversed.
- Used for passwords storage and integrity checking.
- Common Algorithms: SHA-256, MD5 (deprecated)
## Digital Signatures and certificates
- Ensures authenticity and non-repudiation.
- A digital signature uses private key to sign data and public key to verify.
- Certificates (X.509) are issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs) for trust verification (used in HTTPs)
## Example
when visiting https://google.com
- browser verifies certificate signed by CA to ensure authenticity.
